          <p class="answers" id="answer1">
            <span class="answerTitle">What are your best rates?</span>
            <br />
            Our rates depend on you. They can be higher or lower depending on now much you want to pay for that rate. We
            are a mortgage broker and have access to rates and programs with multiple lenders. We will obtain the BEST
            rate available on the market for your situation, Email us for a quote, or see Market Monitor for more
            information.
          </p>
          <p class="answers" id="answer2">
            <span class="answerTitle">Will you tell us when the rate gets to a certain point?</span>
            <br />
            Yes we will! We are monitoring the rates for a number of clients (updated daily). When the rate hits their
            'magic number', we can then lock and contact the client to discuss options. This service is free, and
            although we cant influence rates, we'll be ready when they are - for YOU. Let us know what rate you're
            looking for! Add me to your rate watch list.
          </p>
          <p class="answers" id="answer3">
            <span class="answerTitle">What are average closing costs?</span>
            <br />
            Average closing costs total between 2%-3% of a loan amount. With smaller loans, the percentage will be
            higher, and large loans may be less than 2%. Capital Assets' fee is normally the standard 1% origination.
            Total closing costs will include title, lender, appraiser, prepaids, and escrow amounts. We will be happy to
            get you a good faith estimate of costs - anytime!
          </p>
          <p class="answers" id="answer4">
            <span class="answerTitle">What is a no-cost loan?</span>
            <br />
            A no-cost loan is not really a loan without costs. No one will work for free, including us. Otherwise, we
            wouldn't be in business! No-cost loans are loans with higher rates. If the market rate were 6% on a given
            day, a no-cost loan might be 6.5%. No-cost loans should only be done in certain cases - let's review your
            situation.
          </p>
          <p class="answers" id="answer5">
            <span class="answerTitle">Can you beat my bank?</span>
            <br />
            It depends. Usually, on small mortgages or lines of credit, banks can do better. With a normal purchase or
            refinance, we are faster, we have better programs, and we can match or beat the rates given by the bank. The
            main difference is that we work for you, and we specialize in mortgages - unlike banks or credit unions,
            which are depository institutions and NOT mortgage companies.
          </p>
          <p class="answers" id="answer6">
            <span class="answerTitle">How long does it take to get a loan?</span>
            <br />
            Most loans are processed within approximately two weeks. Our fastest turnaround is usually 2-5 days (for a
            purchase) - from meeting the client to funding the loan. If the loan is a refinance, We have to wait the
            rescission period, which stretches the process a bit. We will push the loan as fast as you want us to. If
            you need help with credit issues, or some additional preparation before the loan is ready to go, we will
            take as much time as needed to prepare you for financing on the best possible terms.
          </p>
          <p class="answers" id="answer7">
            <span class="answerTitle">What paperwork do you need to get a loan?</span>
            <br />
            Please see our Apply Now page for general documents needed. Sometimes we can do without tax returns or
            paystubs, but more is usually better than less. Depending on what kind of loan you need, you may not have to
            provide income or asset documentation. Most lenders, though, will want to verify in some way that you will
            be likely to pay them back! That's reasonable, isnt It?
          </p>
          <p class="answers" id="answer8">
            <span class="answerTitle">Why is my credit score different depending on who checks it?</span>
            <br />
            Credit scores are based on many factors. The main reason for the variation is that a mortgage inquiry (and
            resulting score) will grade a person on a completely different scale than a credit card inquiry, insurance
            inquiry, personal inquiry, etc. They ALL grade and score your credit based on their own unique criteria. So,
            any score but a mongage score is not going to make much difference in qualitying for a mortgage.

            I want to send this to thank you on our behalf in helping us refinance our home mortgage. You were very
            kind, and courteous, and went out of your way to do paper work with unpleasant people, and were consistent
            on letting us know how things were going. Now we will be able to save on interest as well as stay in our

            There just aren't enough words for me to adequately express my thanks to you. I hope that you can FEEL my
            word and how grateful I am for what you have done. It is certainly much more than I expected. Not having a
            house payment in December has been such a great blessing and helped me DO Christmas without going into debt.

            During this whole process you have been such a champion and expert for me. It is a very daunting process and
            even though it was hard fo me, I knew it was what I need to do to get where I could pay off my house before
            I retire and get a newer cat at the same time. It was nice to have someone working on the refinance/loan
            process that I could trust and who was looking out for me. I will look back on this experience as a positive
            one and am grateful for the opportunity to meet you.

            You also know my sister. We were talking a little while ago and I mentioned that I had gone through a
            mortgage broker and was in the process of a refinance/ loan. When I told her I was working with Capital
            Assets, she remembered you guys. What a small world we live in. She had such nice things to say about you
            and your family and it was a reaffirmation too me that I HAD done the right thing and met the right

            I also wnated to thank you for referring me to Capital Assets Utah Valley. He couldn't have been a more
            caring and patient person to work with. He was always so reassuring and pleasant when I was trying to sort
            things out financially and emotionally. It is obvious that he really knows his business. I would not
            hesitate to refer anyone to him. He was so creative in trying various approaches. If one lender wasn't
            willing to give an acceptable offer, he would go to another. I know he spent a lot of time negotiating to
            help us.
